# Dumb-Load-Balancer
A simple Load Balancer that distributes the workload across a pool of servers using the Round Robin Algorithm

# What is a Load Balancer ?
A load balancer is a networking device or software component that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources to ensure efficient and reliable handling of requests. Its primary function is to evenly distribute the workload across the available resources, such as servers, to optimize resource utilization, enhance performance, and maximize reliability.

# Round-Robin Algorithm
The Round Robin Algorithm is a method used by a computer system, like a traffic controller, to distribute incoming tasks or requests among a group of servers or resources in a circular order. Each task is assigned to the next server in line, ensuring a fair and balanced distribution of the workload. It's like taking turns, where each server gets an equal chance to handle tasks, which helps keep the system running efficiently and prevents any one server from being overloaded.
